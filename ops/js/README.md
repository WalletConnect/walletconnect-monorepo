# JS Dev Environment

1. Install python3 and ensure `python` cli is linked (required to build npm modules)
2. Install redis and run it as a [brew service](https://gist.github.com/tomysmile/1b8a321e7c58499ef9f9441b2faa0aa8)
3. Bootstrap lerna (install npm packages) `npm run bootstrap`
4. Verify installation `npm run check`
5. Start relay server ([separate repo](https://github.com/WalletConnect/relay)) `make dev`
6. If you update npm packages, run `npm run test --prefix=packages/sign-client`

# Troubleshooting

1. If you are experiencing issues with installation ensure you install `npm i -g node-gyp`
2. You will need to have xcode command line tools installed
3. If there are issues with xcode command line tools try running

```zsh
sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
sudo xcode-select --reset
```

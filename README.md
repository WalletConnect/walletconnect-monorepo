TEST_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID npm run check
```

## Command Overview

- `check` - Shorthand to run lint, build and test commands
- `reset` - Shorthand to run clean and check commands

## Best Practices

### Development

- **Always run checks**: Use `npm run check` before committing
- **Write tests**: Ensure new features have test coverage
- **Follow conventions**: Maintain code style consistency
- **Document changes**: Update README and docs as needed

### Testing

- **Set TEST_PROJECT_ID**: Required for running tests
- **Run tests locally**: Verify before submitting PRs
- **Check test coverage**: Ensure adequate coverage

### Code Quality

- **Lint before commit**: Catch issues early
- **Use Prettier**: Maintain consistent formatting
- **Review dependencies**: Keep packages up to date

## Troubleshooting

1. If you are experiencing issues with installation ensure you install `npm i -g node-gyp`
2. You will need to have xcode command line tools installed
3. If there are issues with xcode command line tools try running

```zsh
sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
sudo xcode-select --reset
```
